# TDDD48 - Automated Planning - Lab 3 report

## Lab 3.1

Two problems were solved by `yahsp2` and `bfs-f`. Neither of these planners
used all helicopters. Moreover, it was more by chance than for a real purpose.
This can be explained by the fact that the planners do not know that using
several helicopters reduces the time spent.

## Lab 3.2

We added a predicate `can_send` which is set to true at the beginning, and set
it to false while it is sending.

Both `yahsp3` and `itsat` gave a solution to the simple problem.

## Lab 3.3
