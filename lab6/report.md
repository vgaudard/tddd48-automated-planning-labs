# TDDD48 - Automated Planning - Lab 6 report

## Selected maps

The chosen maps are:
* `UniqueSolutionMaze` with its robot
* `Barriers_easy` with its robot

The map `UniqueSolutionMaze` was chosen because it can demonstrate a planner's
ability to find a path in a complex environment, as well as to see if a
planner checks somewhere the robot will not go.

The map `Barriers_easy` was chosen because it requires the robot to rotate
around obstacles. We can then see how how a planner uses the properties of a
non-convex object.

Pictures of these maps and the robots' placements are available in each folder
and are named `base_map_and_robot.png`.
